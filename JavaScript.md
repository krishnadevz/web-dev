**JavaScript**
JavaScript is used for making dynamic websites note:- for understanding this notes clearly you should have knowledge of javascript.

1.**getElementById**
```js <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript in Body</h2>

<p id="demo"></p> //we can use class selctor also 

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript"; //we can use onClick() funcion also 
</script>

</body>
</html> 
``` 

**Display properties in javascript**
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
* Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
* Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
* Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
* Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
* we can write this code in <script> tag or in plain js code.
* A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
* Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
* Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement.
* when we write multiple variable declarations/statements in one line then it is allowed in js but we have to separate that by using semi colons `a=3; b=2; c=a+b;`
* javascript ignores white spaces but we can write like this `var person = "phile" `
* JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.
* JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.
* JavaScript as two values Variable values are called Variables.
* Fixed values are called Literals like strings in ''/"" or simple value assigned.
* assignment is operator is = and also JavaScript is Case Sensitive means Var VAR is not considered as a var.
* hyphens are not allowed in javascript those are reserved for substractions Underscore,lower camelCase and upper CamelCase type variables are allowed in javascript.
* comments in javascript are like this // hello i am revising javascript 
* const keyword to define a variable that cannot be reassigned and let keyword to define a variable with restricted scope.and var is global and can be reasigned by values.
* if we put numbers in string like `var yup="15"` so that will be treated as string because of quotes.
* After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of undefined).
* we can declare many variables in one statement by separating comas or else semi;.
* for concatinating stuff we can use "je"+"fe"=jefe;a and starting with dollars also are valid variable declarations and also we can start with _hello.

**JavaScript assignment operators**
* examples = x=y
* x += y used as a x=x+y same for x=x-y/x=x*y/%=/* *=

* typeof Returns the type of a variable
* instanceof Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
* Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).and important bracket **()** has a first precedance
